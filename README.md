# Newton-s-method-project_Computer-Science-and-Numerical-Methods
This project focuses on approximating the root of the function f(x) = x e^x - 1 using Newton’s method. The method is implemented in Python, and its convergence is analyzed both theoretically and numerically. There are graphical illustrations to show the iterative process and the error decay.
